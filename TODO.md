- [ ] Project running for all team members
    - This was not a task on the ReadMe, but in order to select pizzas, a user will need to see the pizzas on the view. This task could be broken down further by assigning one person to make the axios GET request and one person to make the DOM render the resulting array (while using a mock array to see what it would look like).

- [X] Inventory tasks and add cards as needed
    - This project has a list of starting tasks, but might not be as detailed or exactly how you would like to break up the tasks. Talk with your team about adding more to this list or adding more specific descriptions around some of the tasks to avoid conflicts.
    - Look at Order - Display all pizzas
      TODO
      for an example of how to further break down the tasks.
